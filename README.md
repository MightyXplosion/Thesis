2021 - The closed loop military maintenance workforce:  A simulation-based optimisation approach

**In order to utilise the files contained within you will need to contact the CSC at UNSW Canberra and request the use of the AMMM.**

The folders contained within these project are:

**1. MATLAB Files**

This folder contains the associated MATLAB scripts required to produce useable data contained within the final year report. The MATLAB scripts take the produced excel sheets created by the python code set and extracts the important information to be utilised in a graphical representation. Additional data is also displayed dependant on the plot produced.

**2. Python Code and Excel Sheets**

The associated python code for use with the AMMM model. All code has been commented to directly reflect itâ€™s use.
The excel sheet for use with each code set can be found within the **conf** folder.
Note that this code will not function without the AMMM model.

**3. Presentation and MODSIM paper**

This folder contains the presentation utilised during the SME verification presentation to Defence Industry specialists. Note that the comments within each page do not truly reflect the presentation given but were used as a guide during the presentation.
A video recording of the presentation is held by the CSC at UNSW Canberra.
Additionally the accepted MODSIM conferance paper is also contained within this folder.

**4. Simulation Spreadsheets**

This folder contains the excel spreadsheets utilised in conjunction with the AMMM. Note that these files formed the test bed for initial analysis of outputs from the AMMM. It is not an exhaustive collection of the tests run; however, contains the most important runs for verification and utilisation purposes.
